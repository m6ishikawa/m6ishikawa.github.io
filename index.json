[{"body":"This is the 2nd drawing practice note by a beginner for an illustration.\nToday's illustration Left one of next illustrations is one before I practiced and right side is one after I practiced. I haven't finished painting colors, like adding shades or shadows, to them in order to check and practice what can be significantly better in terms of lines drawings at first.\n  Before After       It might be hard to notice what was changed, but I practiced hands and fingers because it looked weird on the left illustration.\nThese are summaries for today's practice\n Hands are complex so that we should draw roughs by multiple steps, and not by a single step. In some cases, it's better to draw after most of other parts is complete, especially when hands do not affect other parts There are many small things that could change an impression of fingers.  Here is the links to today's illustration on my SNS accounts.\n Link to Pixiv  I tried these steps to improve this original illustration, which was the same way as last time.\n Figure out what can be better Pick up a few things I need to focus on improving Practice and figure out a few things I have to do Redraw the illustration and check what was improve  1. What can be better I checked my original illustration and listed up what can be better. These are what I thought:\n Fingers of a right hand were supposed to be bent and also be thinner Drawing nails, like shapes or the sizes, can be improved especially when fingers are bent Skin colors can be more natural than current colors Chains of her belt can be bigger so viewers can recognize them The position of her right elbow is supposed to be higher Details can be added around her right breast The lines surrounding her breast can be to imply the size of her bust by being drawn by shorter widths The stregnth of a darker pen and lighter pen with same size isn't so different  I used a darker pen for the frame lines of most of body, cloths, or accessories, and use a lighter pen inside lines of each body part, cloth, or accessory. LIghter pen with the same width should be used for a real or clear line, but shouldn't be used for weak lines like a wrinkle. For it, it's better to make the width smaller.   The position of her left shoulder is better to be lower Gravity should be considered more. I considered it when I drew her hairs or ear rings, but it was not sufficient and also it can't be seen for a skirt.  2. What I practiced I practiced hands, especially fingers, and those when fingers are bent\nVideos that I checked in order to learn how to draw hands:\n YouTube: Love2DrawManga - Tips for Drawing Hands! (Japanese) YouTube: Naoki Saito Illust Channel - Tips to draw charming hands anyone can do easily /【誰でも簡単】手を魅力的に描くコツ  Also, I practiced drawing hands by a croquis by watching next video.\n YouTube: Enahkre - 23 One Minute Hand References  But I noticed it was especially hard to draw fingers being bent to the far side, and not bent to the left or right sides. So, I practiced hands that fingers were bent but the point of view isn't diagonal, because I thought it was the best practice for this illustration.\n3. What I found As I wrote, at first, I tried a croquis, and next illustration is an example of what I drew. It's really good to practice hands by a croquis, especially a lot of forms, but not good to find new things and how I can improve.\nThen, next illustration was the one I tried to draw and tried to find what I could improve, though each of them was small thing.\nBesides, during this practice, I noticed it's better to draw hands by multiple roughs, to make it better gradually. I had drew the hand in the original illustration very rough at first, and jumped to draw complete hand, but a hand is complex and drawing hands should be taken care more like other human parts. I think if the hands are not the main part of an illustration, it's probably better to draw roughs of hands after roughs for most of other body parts ended because it's doesn't affect other body parts so much but may get affected by other body parts a lot.\nOther learnings Custome brush This was the 1st time to use a custom brush. I used it for the chain on her skirt. In order to use it, I just downloaded \u0026quot;Necklace brush\u0026quot; made by Fukomu (ふうこむ) and used it.\nThere is an official help page for how to use downloaded brushes, so check it out for more details.\nWhat I redrew and what was improved As I posted on the top of this page, this is the illustration after I modified her hands.\nI think these are improved points:\n The shapes of nails became more natural Each part of hands can now be distinguished clearer. It can be done more by drawing lines clearer around knuckles. Fingers became thinner and more natural Fingers on the left hands become more natural because skins under nails can be seen on this angle Fingers might be too straight after modifying it  Wrap it up First thing first, hands and fingers are small parts compared to other body parts. It's better to draw them by multiple roughs and draw them gradually to make them natural. The shapes or angles of hands can be changed variously on each situation, so it's really hard to find the common techniques to draw them in any situation other than those introduced in the learning materials shared on this page. So, I'll need practices in each case.\n","link":"https://m6ishikawa.github.io/posts/2021/03/26/2021/03/26-practice-illustrations/","title":"2021/03/26 Practice illustrations"},{"body":"","link":"https://m6ishikawa.github.io/posts/","title":"Posts"},{"body":"This is a note when I, a very beginnner of an illustration, practiced drawing an illustration. I left them here so I can refer to this in the future.\nToday's illustration These illustrations are those I drew very seriously, but left one is before practice and right one is after practice.\n  Before After       Here is the links to today's illustration on my SNS accounts.\n Link to Pixiv  I tried these steps to improve this original illustration.\n Figure out what can be better Pick up a few things I need to focus on improving Practice and figure out a few things I have to do Redraw the illustration and check what was improve  These steps are from some steps as Naoki-sensei introduced in his video to get drawing better as early as possible in 3 months (no English).\n1. What can be better I listed up what I felt these can be improved.\nFace and hair  Smiling face should be more natural, less weird, maybe around eyes or mouth is a cause. The line of eyes makes a weird impression and looks like fox. The line of the face isn't very natural, perhaps the face may be bigger or the jaw can be rounder. The amount of her hair may be more The angle of her side tail hair can be improved and can be more natural.  Body  Her breast from the side view isn't well drawn. The angle of the necklace (choker?) looks weird and not right. The shirt collar looks weird shape. It can be drawn better between her arms and body.  2. What I practiced Even though there are many things I was able to, I focused on these 2 things\n Facial expressions, including a smiling face Heads, especially faces,, from multiple angles  I also noticed I didn't draw ATARI and it was helpful to draw a head from a diagonal angle. ATARI is simple circles, rectangles, or lines to show the rough position or the size. I don't know how to say correctly in English, so I'll say it a wire in this page.    During practice, I read or checked these as learning materials:\n Book: Introduction to master faces, hair styles, and expressions in Manga from any angle (360°どんな角度もカンペキマスター!マンガキャラ顔・髪型・表情入門)  Checked the pages to draw the head from each angle   YouTube: Naoki Saito Illust Channel: Lecture to draw each expression easily (【簡単】表情の描き分け講座)  No English subtitle You can see how eyebrows, eyes, or a mouth affect each expression    And following illustrations are examples of what I drew.\n Facial expressions  Change an angle of each face part  Change a position of each face part    Heads from multiple angles  Drew without a wire  Drew with a wire     3. What I found Facial expressions I changed each part of a face and checked how it affects, but because there are so many patterns and not very particular common things, I couldn't find a lot.\nThe things I found was followings, though I saw these in the above video:\n Distance between eyes and jaw: Shorter it is, more childish  And from the above video, eyebrows show what expression is mostly, and mouth shows how strong the expression is. Anyway, I felt that the weirdness of my original illustration was from the face of the angle and not from the smile face.\nHeads from many angles I found these things:\n Angles affect each distance and shape  If the angle is from the above, the distance between a nose and a mouth is short. It's opposite if the angle is from the bottom. The eye is not on the straight line, but it's on the curved line. If the camera position is closer, then the head gets big and wide. It's opposite if the part of the head is far away. If the angle is from the bottom, then the bottom part of a jaw can also be seen and we have to be conscious For the side profile, the size of eyes gets smaller than other angles For the side profile, the size of head is not complete circle. It's bigger than circle Eyeline is important.    But overall, how to see a head and face is case by case on each angle, so it's better to see a model and check how it looks during drawing an illustration always.\nOther learning Draw frame lines with equal margins It's a side topic, but it was helpful when I drew many illustrations and changed each a little bit from others. On Clip Studio Paint, it's easily be prepared by:\n Select Frame borders \u0026gt; Recntagle frame and draw it Right click the Frame layer and select Ruler/Frame \u0026gt; Divide frame border equally You can choose options for the number of vertical and horizontal divisions and also divide folders  What I redraw and what was improved So, again, this is the same image on the top of this page.\nWhat I changed was\n Eye angles: Before updating, eyes were drawn as if it's on the straight line, but after practice, eyes were like on the curved line. Eye and mouth positions: They were low compared to positions of ears and jaw, so I lifted them up.  I think it reduced the weirdness of smiles from the original illustration.\nWrap it up This is the first time to write a post for an illustration and actually, I didn't think I was going to do while I was practicing, so maybe some illustrations or some explanations are not explained enough to be understood. Anyway, I felt it didn't improve a lot as I wanted, but at least changed the impression a little bit and reduce the weirdness. I guess face is one of the most important part in our body and made a big impact by changing it.\nAnyway, I'll keep doing this and hope it's gonna change my drawing skills.\n","link":"https://m6ishikawa.github.io/posts/2021/03/21/illustration-practice/","title":"2021/03/21 Practice illustrations"},{"body":"Adobe After Effects is mainly described in this page.\n How to show that a camera moves on one image  Scale in/out the image Change the position of the image   How to organize assets  Use pre-compose.

Other tools ffmpeg ffmpeg is a useful command line tool to encode, trim, or do other things for video files. The example of trimming and copy a video without encoding is something like this ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss HH:MM:SS -to HH:MM:SS -c copy output.mp4.\nHere is brief explanation of each option:\n Encoding: -c option  See Tutorial - Using FFMPEG for DNxHD/DNxHR encoding, resizing, and batch encoding for more details Instead of -c, -c:a for audio and -c:v for video can be used   Trimming: -ss and -to options  See Trim video files using FFmpeg or Cutting the videos based on start and end time using ffmpeg for more details. When trimmings, there might be a black screen without showing anything on the beginning or end of the videos. It can be avoided by -allow_negative_rs make_zero.  See How to avoid the black screen at the beginning? for more details      Also, there is an other way to use ffmpeg.\n Check a resolution of video: ffmpeg -i [file]  Spleeter Spleeter is a tool to extract audios from a video.
