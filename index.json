[{"body":"This is the note for my practice to an illustration as a beginner.\nToday's illustration The next left illustration is the one before I practiced and right onw is after I did.\n  Before After       In this time, I practiced and learned these things\n Colors for shades and shadows of hairs  Even if the color of shade and shadow is different from the basic hair color, it doesn't screw up the illustration. The different color gives a different impression as well as another information of a character. Colors depend on each character, and it's OK to use the different color for shade and shadows even though different characters have the identical hair color.   Colors for lights  This also affects how you wanna show your illustration, especially what the surrounding area of the character is.    Besides the above points, I modified a little bit about shade and shadow colors to make them weaker. To practice, I tried these steps to improve this original illustration:\n Reviewed my illustration by myself Picked up a few things for improvements Practiced and figured out a few things I though I can improve Redrew my illustration and checked what was improved  Before coloring shades and shadows The illustration I practiced today is the one I drew on this article. And before drawing shades and shadows, I modified several things to improve it:\n  Original Modified       What I modified was\n Changed color layer below to line layer, which I learned on this article. Edited the eyes' positions lower, and also changed their angles little bit Edited the head smaller Edited the sidetail hair and hair ribbon closer to the ear Added details on the cloth Added a frame line Changed a skin color from too yello to red-ish  After these changes, I added shades, shadows, and high lights on the illustration.\n  Before coloring details After coloring details       Review my illustration I reviewed my illustration after I painted shades and shadows.\nWhat can be better  Face can still be more natural, further Lights can be more emphasized using highlights on many places other than hairs. The star on her tie can look less flat Cheek can be drawn more natural Hair can be made less flat, especially the front part of her hair Her plaid jacket can look less flat, probably because no shade nor shadow Her hair ribbon can look more solid, especially lower part of ribbons should look the far side more than the above one It's not weird, but it might be more modern that the color of shadows are closer to the original skin?  What was drawn well  Overall colors of shadows and how they looked. I intentionally chose strong colors for shadows Hair highlights. This was one of the most difficult thing for me to draw well on this illustration Where I should add shadows  Practice and lessons At first, I watched a few videos for shades, shadows, and lights. I had checked some of them, but revisited again in order to get ideas better and refreshed my memory. Unfortunatelly, all fo them is Japanese audio.\n YouTube: Naoki Saito illust Channel - How to draw attractive hairs of characters for digital illustrations (Japanese) YouTube: Deep Blizzard's Art School - How not to fail choosing skin colors of characters for digital illustrations (Japanese) YouTube: Deep Blizzard's Art School - How to Shade Hair [Super Introductory Course #40] Deep Blizzard (Japanese)  After watching these videos, next things are especially something I remembered well:\n The shade and shadow colors of hairs can change impressions of characters. In other words, we do not have to stick with which color is right or not. It's one way to change impressions of a character. More details of shades, shadows or lights are added, more relistic an illustration is.  But anime character illustration is a way to deform a person, so sometimes, more realistic doesn't always mean it's good.   If the highlight of hairs is jagged, then it shows the pieces of hairs are lighten up  But I feel if we try to draw jagged too much, it's gonna be more realistic drawing rather than deformed one.    So, from these learnings, I felt next things are important and decided to try practicing these things mainly for this illustration:\n Hair's shadow colors How to draw lights  Hair's shade and shadow colors Following what Naoki said on this video, I did the same things to change multiple colors for how different color of shades and shadows changes impressions, and decide which one looks the best. But when I tried doing it, I noticed I cannot color to what I wanted, because I usually use a \u0026quot;multiply\u0026quot; layer for shade and shadow, and it is affected by the color of its base color layer.\nSo, I tried a multiply layer to add a few colors which I wanna show, and also use a normal layer to color the shade and shadow for what I wanted to try. These are the things I tried.\nUsing a multiply layer. I wanted to color shade and shadows to red and yellow in a few of them, but it shows purples and green, respectively. Using a normal layer. From these practices, what I felt was\n  When shade and shadow is colored by different colors like red, yellow, or green, it adds new information or impression the character.\n On the other hand, because the base hair color is blue, when shade and shadows are colored by one close to the base color, it doesn't change any impression.    Using multiply layers can add shade and shadow with different colors, but sometimes it leads to unexpected colors. It looks more natural and fits to an illustration easily, but it might not be something you wanted.\n  Using normal layers with different colors, it can add different colors easily, but it's challenging to use completely different colors. It might be good in a few cases, like characters in a fantasy story, but may not be good in some cases.\n  I actually like to add red shades on the above practice, because I felt it added an impression for passionate and warmth, so I decided to use it, though her character color is blue.\nAttempts to learn how to draw lights I couldn't find very good videos or articles to talk about where we should put lights on faces or clothese concretely, so I tried a few ways to add lights and see what and how it changes.\nPractice: I only tried 5 patterns where I should put lights. I couldn't come up with other ways to drastically change the lights except changing light colors. But I guess changing light colors is almost similar effect which I learned from shades and shadows, so I skipped it. Also, as you can see, I removed a black outer line from \u0026quot;Lights on outer parts\u0026quot; illustration because it reduced effects of lights.\nFrom this practice, things I thought:\n Adding lights can be used to get paid attentions to the places where are lighten part  Because it is strongly get paid attentions, if lights are not important, it's better to draw them only a small amount   When lights are drawn on a specific side, it strongly emphasizes the existence of lights and i felt the light in such an illustration is very important factor. The lights on the border of a character are a little bit different impressions from other lights. I can be wrong but it's more like emphasizing a character her/himself, like a character is lively.  Though I also felt it implies the environment or situation is filled with a full of lights    What I redrew and what was improved So from these learnings, I redrew my original illustration, as I showed it on the beginning of this page.\nBesides changing the color of shade and shadow of hair and highlights, I edited the color for other shades and shadows too, in order to make them weaker. It might not be necessary, but I felt it implied how dark her surrounding environment was.\nFrom what I learned, I think it changed my illustration well. These things completely depend on how I wanted to show on the illustration, and not something like there is a correct answer, but it makes the illustration be what I wanted to imagine a little bit, to show that she is in a lighten place and also she is lively.\nAttempt to add a background I didn't plan to add any background, but all of a sudden, I wanted to have a background to make this illustration better, so tried to add simple background.\n I hope this background can show that she is lighten up by a moon, and doesn't mismatch with the shades, shadows, and lights I added.\nWrap up Here is the links to today's illustration on my SNS accounts.\n Pixiv DeviantArt  Also, for future improvements, I felt it's probably better to try drawing anime characters by deforming from real people, so that we can understand how to draw lines, colors, shades, shadows, and lights. I didn't do it, but will try it and see how useful it is some day.\n","link":"https://m6ishikawa.github.io/posts/2021/05/08/2021/05/07-practice-to-color-shades-and-shadows-of-hairs-and-lights-of-a-character/","title":"2021/05/07 Practice to color shades and shadows of hairs and lights of a character"},{"body":"","link":"https://m6ishikawa.github.io/posts/","title":"Posts"},{"body":"This is the note for my practice to an illustration by a beginner.\nToday's illustration The above illustration is the one before I practiced and below one is after I practiced. I haven't finished coloring most of shades and shadows because I would update the original illustration after this practice.\nBefore After In this time, I changed face and head to make them look a character more female, because originally it doesn't look. These are summaries for my learnings:\n In many articles or many people said, womens should be drawn more rounded and not sharp or square shapes. Consider affected areas while drawing lines especially it's not from front view. In this case, I should have cared how the cheek and jaw look when I drew a mouth and eyes Eyes are not wide enough to touch with a side hair from a profile view. I should have drawn smaller.  Here is the links to today's illustration on my SNS accounts.\n Link to Pixiv  I tried these steps to improve this original illustration:\n Self review my illustration Pick up a few things for improvements Practice and figure out a few things I can improve Redraw my illustration and check what was improved  Review my illustration What can be better  The head or face can be softer and look her more like a woman Breast can look more 3D and also can recognize its shape Skirt should be affected by gravity, so should belt chains Directions of hands or nails can be more natural towards the far side Hairs can have more details Hair pin can look more natural from this angle It's obvious that boots are duplicated, so make them less obvious  What was drawn well  The pleat on the skirt looks good, and also its wrinkle does, too One of boots is drawn well Shape of legs is not so weird  What I practiced On this time, I chose to practice improving the head and face of the illustration. From this head, I felt a creepy impression from this illustration, especially because she is not a female. At first, I need to figure out why it does.\nI just hide color layers and frame line layer, but it didn't change the impression so much, so it turned out it's from line layers.\nSo, I copied original illustration and changed a little bit on each head or body part, and see how's gonna be changed. Following illustrations are things I changed and saw how it changes.\nPractice 1 Practice 2 Practice 3 (Improve an original illustration one by one) What I found I still feels it's not completely natural for a woman's character, but it's hard for me to figure out why it isn't. I need to have an ability to recognize what gives how I feel, but things I found this time are:\n In many articles or many people said, womens should be drawn more rounded and not sharp or square shapes. Consider affected areas while drawing lines especially it's not from front view. In this case, I should have cared how the cheek and jaw look when I drew a mouth and eyes Eyes are not wide enough to touch with a side hair from a profile view. I should have drawn smaller.  What I redrew and what was improved So, I redrew the illustration with these changes. And this is the one I redrew after the practice.\nAnd I completely remove the line of the side of the jaw and instead color the shade of the neck, because the line still gave me an impression as a male character. Instead of showing the line, I change the layer of it to the draft layer, so that it won't show up after I export it to an image, if I'm not mistaken. But this change may not be necessary, because when you can see anime, the line for a jaw is clearly drawn for a profile.\n","link":"https://m6ishikawa.github.io/posts/2021/04/09/2021/04/08-practice-drawing-a-head-and-face-from-a-profile-view/","title":"2021/04/08 Practice drawing a head and face from a profile view"},{"body":"This is the 3rd note for an illustration by a beginner.\nToday's illustration Next left illustration is the one before I learned and right one is after I learned. I haven't finished coloring shades and shadows because I would update the original illustration after this practice. This time, it's gonna be easier to see the difference of 2 illustrations when you turn off a dark mode.\n  Before After       In this time, I learned how to color an illustration. These are summaries for what I changed on Clip Studio Paint.\n Change a layer structure  Before: Line layer is below a color layer After: Line layer is above a color layer   Create new layer for a character silhouette to clip from other layers Enable some options to color more cleanly on Fill tool  Fill narrow areas Fill up to vector path    Here is the links to today's illustration on my SNS accounts.\n Link to Pixiv  I tried these steps to improve this original illustration:\n Self review my illustration Pick up a few things I need to focus on improving Learned how to do Draw my illustration by new way  1. Review my illustration What can be better  An upper body can be more straight. Right now, it's a little bit leaning to the left Head might be bigger or shape might be wider Stripes, especially gray lines, of arms can be bigger so it's gonna be impressive and noticeable Outer frame line of a chracter can be sharpen and can remove a tons of circles The shape of shoes can make it better. Actually I didn't see a real shoes while I was drawing Knee can be wider so that we can avoid making an impression that she has big muscles in her thigh or calf The shape of the crown can be better wider to the top from the bottom. Currently, it's almost flat Sleeves of her arms can be shorter and can be drawn and make different impressions There are transparent spaces surrounding lines due to anti-aliasing Skin colors can be changed to more pink from yellow The ribbon of her sidetail hair can be more rounded so that it can make a feeling an shape of the hair. It's too straight right now Each pleats on the skirt can be separated more. Now it looks flat a lot The dark blue part of her skirt can be more lighter. Maybe white lines or yellow lines can be bigger and more noticeable. The central line of deep gray stripe lines can be wider It might be too flat color. It might be relieved by increasing the number of colors?  What was drawn well  It took time but drew her full body Stripes of her costume. This requires a lot of works, but drew well with drawing lines over and over instead of using Fill tool Draw the hairlines of the back of her head but it looks natural A gradiation of the ribbon on her back Frill of a skirt Vertical ratios of bodies, from head to shoes  2. What I learned This time, I picked up There are transparent spaces surrounding lines due to anti-aliasing from what can be better and learned how to color on Clip Studio Paint.\nI hadn't learned it so much, and sometimes couldn't fill some empty areas very well even though I tried to use \u0026quot;Paint unfilled area\u0026quot; on Fill tool and didn't work as expected. I thought it was because I enabled an anti-aliasing option of the vector layer, but also I was sure there was a way to solve it. So, I spent time to learn and solve it on this time.\nAt first, I watched these videos for coloring:\n YouTube: Baban Illustration - QUICK FLATS AND COLORING IN CLIP STUDIO PAINT AND MANGA STUDIO - HOW TO USE SELECTION AND FILL TOOL (Japanese) YouTube: Deep Blizzard's Art School - ④はじめてのクリスタ／レイヤー・色塗り1【超入門講座#26】 #ディープブリザード​ #clipstudio​  From the videos, I noticed I colored my illustration differently.\n The order of line and color layers is different  I also didn't use some options due to this difference   I didn't prepare one color layer of a character to clip from other layers  One layer to be painted by single color It's something like silhouette layer. I do not know how to call this layer    Structure of layers It seems layers of some illustrators are ordered by\n Special effects like highlights Line Color  But I drew my illustration by following orders\n (Lines over colors) Colors Line  So I followed other illustrastrators structure and tried to color my illustration by this structure.\nCreate a layer to draw a color with a character Next, I actually didn't prepare one layer for a clip from other layers, like next image:\nBut it seems some illustrators do this before start coloring details not to draw outside of a character. So I decided to follow this and learned how to do, especially it could reduce my mistakes.\nIn order to fill a character from line layers, we can do it relatively easily by using Auto select and Invert selected area on Select menu.\n Choose Auto select tool and select the area except a character Select Select \u0026gt; Invert selected area After select a layer to fill by a single color, click Fill icon on the command bar, which is under the menu bar  This should work. You may fill an area which you do not want to, in that case, undo and choose the areas when you select on Auto select tool.\nEnable useful options for coloring These are options I missed or I couldn't turn on\n When you choose Refer other layers on the Fill tool, enable Fill narrow area under Close gap. You may need to show it from Show [Sub Tool Detail palette]... menu. Enable Fill up to vector path option  I didn't use this because I originally show color layers above the line, not below the line layers. And this option made my illustration worse.    Just coloring an illustration From the above things, I colored my illustrations without changing line layers. Next images are those of before and after I applied what I described on this page.\nAs you can see, it improved a lot because there is no empty space surrounding some lines like the lines of her back ribbon. Because we do not change anything on line layers, there are some lines that should be hidden by the back of the ribbon or the crown. I also prepared outer frame line from the silhouette layer with \u0026quot;Border effect\u0026quot; of such a layer.\n  Before After       Then after I cleaned up some line layers, then I made the illustration posted on the top of this page.\nTried to mix line colors with the colors from surrounding areas I also compared when I tried to change line colors to mix the colors from surrounding areas, by creating new layer from color layers and apply a Gaussian blur, but my original approach didn't improve it at all because I clipped the layer from the line layers and empty spaces I failed to draw didn't get changed.\nWrap it up So, even if I turn on anti aliasing on vector modes, I can improve coloring significantly I didn't doubt my layer structure isn't so much different from others for some reasons, so it's always better to check what other illustrators said if something doesn't work, tried it, and compare what the result would be.\n","link":"https://m6ishikawa.github.io/posts/2021/04/05/2021/04/05-practice-learn-how-to-color-an-illustration-on-clip-studio-paint/","title":"2021/04/05 Practice: Learn how to color an illustration on Clip Studio Paint"},{"body":"This is the 2nd drawing practice note by a beginner for an illustration.\nToday's illustration Left one of next illustrations is one before I practiced and right side is one after I practiced. I haven't finished painting colors, like adding shades or shadows, to them in order to check and practice what can be significantly better in terms of lines drawings at first.\n  Before After       It might be hard to notice what was changed, but I practiced hands and fingers because it looked weird on the left illustration.\nThese are summaries for today's practice\n Hands are complex so that we should draw roughs by multiple steps, and not by a single step. In some cases, it's better to draw after most of other parts is complete, especially when hands do not affect other parts There are many small things that could change an impression of fingers.  Here is the links to today's illustration on my SNS accounts.\n Link to Pixiv  I tried these steps to improve this original illustration, which was the same way as last time.\n Figure out what can be better Pick up a few things I need to focus on improving Practice and figure out a few things I have to do Redraw the illustration and check what was improve  1. What can be better I checked my original illustration and listed up what can be better. These are what I thought:\n Fingers of a right hand were supposed to be bent and also be thinner Drawing nails, like shapes or the sizes, can be improved especially when fingers are bent Skin colors can be more natural than current colors Chains of her belt can be bigger so viewers can recognize them The position of her right elbow is supposed to be higher Details can be added around her right breast The lines surrounding her breast can be to imply the size of her bust by being drawn by shorter widths The stregnth of a darker pen and lighter pen with same size isn't so different  I used a darker pen for the frame lines of most of body, cloths, or accessories, and use a lighter pen inside lines of each body part, cloth, or accessory. LIghter pen with the same width should be used for a real or clear line, but shouldn't be used for weak lines like a wrinkle. For it, it's better to make the width smaller.   The position of her left shoulder is better to be lower Gravity should be considered more. I considered it when I drew her hairs or ear rings, but it was not sufficient and also it can't be seen for a skirt.  2. What I practiced I practiced hands, especially fingers, and those when fingers are bent\nVideos that I checked in order to learn how to draw hands:\n YouTube: Love2DrawManga - Tips for Drawing Hands! (Japanese) YouTube: Naoki Saito Illust Channel - Tips to draw charming hands anyone can do easily /【誰でも簡単】手を魅力的に描くコツ  Also, I practiced drawing hands by a croquis by watching next video.\n YouTube: Enahkre - 23 One Minute Hand References  But I noticed it was especially hard to draw fingers being bent to the far side, and not bent to the left or right sides. So, I practiced hands that fingers were bent but the point of view isn't diagonal, because I thought it was the best practice for this illustration.\n3. What I found As I wrote, at first, I tried a croquis, and next illustration is an example of what I drew. It's really good to practice hands by a croquis, especially a lot of forms, but not good to find new things and how I can improve.\nThen, next illustration was the one I tried to draw and tried to find what I could improve, though each of them was small thing.\nBesides, during this practice, I noticed it's better to draw hands by multiple roughs, to make it better gradually. I had drew the hand in the original illustration very rough at first, and jumped to draw complete hand, but a hand is complex and drawing hands should be taken care more like other human parts. I think if the hands are not the main part of an illustration, it's probably better to draw roughs of hands after roughs for most of other body parts ended because it's doesn't affect other body parts so much but may get affected by other body parts a lot.\nOther learnings Custome brush This was the 1st time to use a custom brush. I used it for the chain on her skirt. In order to use it, I just downloaded \u0026quot;Necklace brush\u0026quot; made by Fukomu (ふうこむ) and used it.\nThere is an official help page for how to use downloaded brushes, so check it out for more details.\nWhat I redrew and what was improved As I posted on the top of this page, this is the illustration after I modified her hands.\nI think these are improved points:\n The shapes of nails became more natural Each part of hands can now be distinguished clearer. It can be done more by drawing lines clearer around knuckles. Fingers became thinner and more natural Fingers on the left hands become more natural because skins under nails can be seen on this angle Fingers might be too straight after modifying it  Wrap it up First thing first, hands and fingers are small parts compared to other body parts. It's better to draw them by multiple roughs and draw them gradually to make them natural. The shapes or angles of hands can be changed variously on each situation, so it's really hard to find the common techniques to draw them in any situation other than those introduced in the learning materials shared on this page. So, I'll need practices in each case.\n","link":"https://m6ishikawa.github.io/posts/2021/03/26/2021/03/26-practice-illustrations/","title":"2021/03/26 Practice illustrations"},{"body":"This is a note when I, a very beginnner of an illustration, practiced drawing an illustration. I left them here so I can refer to this in the future.\nToday's illustration These illustrations are those I drew very seriously, but left one is before practice and right one is after practice.\n  Before After       Here is the links to today's illustration on my SNS accounts.\n Link to Pixiv  I tried these steps to improve this original illustration.\n Figure out what can be better Pick up a few things I need to focus on improving Practice and figure out a few things I have to do Redraw the illustration and check what was improve  These steps are from some steps as Naoki-sensei introduced in his video to get drawing better as early as possible in 3 months (no English).\n1. What can be better I listed up what I felt these can be improved.\nFace and hair  Smiling face should be more natural, less weird, maybe around eyes or mouth is a cause. The line of eyes makes a weird impression and looks like fox. The line of the face isn't very natural, perhaps the face may be bigger or the jaw can be rounder. The amount of her hair may be more The angle of her side tail hair can be improved and can be more natural.  Body  Her breast from the side view isn't well drawn. The angle of the necklace (choker?) looks weird and not right. The shirt collar looks weird shape. It can be drawn better between her arms and body.  2. What I practiced Even though there are many things I was able to, I focused on these 2 things\n Facial expressions, including a smiling face Heads, especially faces,, from multiple angles  I also noticed I didn't draw ATARI and it was helpful to draw a head from a diagonal angle. ATARI is simple circles, rectangles, or lines to show the rough position or the size. I don't know how to say correctly in English, so I'll say it a wire in this page.    During practice, I read or checked these as learning materials:\n Book: Introduction to master faces, hair styles, and expressions in Manga from any angle (360°どんな角度もカンペキマスター!マンガキャラ顔・髪型・表情入門)  Checked the pages to draw the head from each angle   YouTube: Naoki Saito Illust Channel: Lecture to draw each expression easily (【簡単】表情の描き分け講座)  No English subtitle You can see how eyebrows, eyes, or a mouth affect each expression    And following illustrations are examples of what I drew.\n Facial expressions  Change an angle of each face part  Change a position of each face part    Heads from multiple angles  Drew without a wire  Drew with a wire     3. What I found Facial expressions I changed each part of a face and checked how it affects, but because there are so many patterns and not very particular common things, I couldn't find a lot.\nThe things I found was followings, though I saw these in the above video:\n Distance between eyes and jaw: Shorter it is, more childish  And from the above video, eyebrows show what expression is mostly, and mouth shows how strong the expression is. Anyway, I felt that the weirdness of my original illustration was from the face of the angle and not from the smile face.\nHeads from many angles I found these things:\n Angles affect each distance and shape  If the angle is from the above, the distance between a nose and a mouth is short. It's opposite if the angle is from the bottom. The eye is not on the straight line, but it's on the curved line. If the camera position is closer, then the head gets big and wide. It's opposite if the part of the head is far away. If the angle is from the bottom, then the bottom part of a jaw can also be seen and we have to be conscious For the side profile, the size of eyes gets smaller than other angles For the side profile, the size of head is not complete circle. It's bigger than circle Eyeline is important.    But overall, how to see a head and face is case by case on each angle, so it's better to see a model and check how it looks during drawing an illustration always.\nOther learning Draw frame lines with equal margins It's a side topic, but it was helpful when I drew many illustrations and changed each a little bit from others. On Clip Studio Paint, it's easily be prepared by:\n Select Frame borders \u0026gt; Recntagle frame and draw it Right click the Frame layer and select Ruler/Frame \u0026gt; Divide frame border equally You can choose options for the number of vertical and horizontal divisions and also divide folders  What I redraw and what was improved So, again, this is the same image on the top of this page.\nWhat I changed was\n Eye angles: Before updating, eyes were drawn as if it's on the straight line, but after practice, eyes were like on the curved line. Eye and mouth positions: They were low compared to positions of ears and jaw, so I lifted them up.  I think it reduced the weirdness of smiles from the original illustration.\nWrap it up This is the first time to write a post for an illustration and actually, I didn't think I was going to do while I was practicing, so maybe some illustrations or some explanations are not explained enough to be understood. Anyway, I felt it didn't improve a lot as I wanted, but at least changed the impression a little bit and reduce the weirdness. I guess face is one of the most important part in our body and made a big impact by changing it.\nAnyway, I'll keep doing this and hope it's gonna change my drawing skills.\n","link":"https://m6ishikawa.github.io/posts/2021/03/21/illustration-practice/","title":"2021/03/21 Practice illustrations"},{"body":"Adobe After Effects is mainly described in this page.\n How to show that a camera moves on one image  Scale in/out the image Change the position of the image   How to organize assets  Use pre-compose.
