Today's illustration Left one of next illustrations is one before I practiced and right side is one after I practiced. I haven't finished painting colors, like adding shades or shadows, to them in order to check and practice what can be significantly better in terms of lines drawings at first.
Before After It might be hard to notice what was changed, but I practiced hands and fingers because it looked weird on the left illustration.</description></item><item><title>2021/03/21 Practice illustrations</title><link>https://m6ishikawa.github.io/posts/2021/03/21/illustration-practice/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 08:41:32 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://m6ishikawa.github.io/posts/2021/03/21/illustration-practice/</guid><description>This is a note when I, a very beginnner of an illustration, practiced drawing an illustration. I left them here so I can refer to this in the future.
Today's illustration These illustrations are those I drew very seriously, but left one is before practice and right one is after practice.
Before After Here is the links to today's illustration on my SNS accounts.</description></item></channel></rss>
